Project Title: Smart Waste Management System

Technologies Used: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Project Summary:
The Smart Waste Management System is a technology-driven solution designed to automate waste classification and enhance recycling processes. The system enables users to upload images of waste, which are then analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the type of waste (e.g., plastic, organic, metal, etc.). Based on this classification, the system provides recommendations for proper recycling or disposal.

Key Features:

Image-Based Waste Identification:
Users upload waste images through a web-based interface.
A CNN algorithm processes the image and classifies the waste.
User-Friendly Interface:
Developed using HTML and CSS, ensuring ease of use.
Database Management:
MySQL database stores user data and waste classifications for reporting and tracking purposes.
Sustainability Focus:
Promotes eco-friendly practices by automating the recycling process.
Your Contributions:

Frontend Development: Designed and implemented the web interface using HTML and CSS to ensure a smooth user experience.
Database Design: Created and managed the MySQL database for storing user submissions and classification results.
Collaboration with AI: Assisted in integrating the CNN algorithm to achieve accurate waste classification.
Skills Demonstrated:

Proficiency in Python for backend processing and AI model integration.
Knowledge of SQL for database creation and management.
Hands-on experience with HTML/CSS for frontend development.
Understanding of machine learning algorithms and their real-world applications.
Outcome:
This project highlights the potential of combining AI, web development, and database management to solve environmental challenges. It provided valuable insights into building practical, user-centric applications with a focus on sustainability.
